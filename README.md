This code takes the values of resistance measured on Platinum line with deposited on top aluminium stripes. All done with the hope to find induced superconductivty in Platium (from the Al) at low temperatures (mK).
However, nothing concluse can be seen from the data.

The values given in the 1st table are:
-Current
-Voltage
And in the 2nd table
-Temperature

The code implements linear fitting and chi-sqare method to asses the data.
